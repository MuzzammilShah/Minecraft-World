> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project was originally developed to run on MacOS, but unfortunately with the lack of compatibility with the new Apple Silicon caused various different issues due to which the world did not render as expected.
> This repository follows a simple standard code, so it can also be run on a windows machine where it supports this relatively better.
> If you would like to see a more advanced version of the world, head on to `archive/pilot/` directory.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project was only meant for fun and was done in less than 12 hours, it is by no means perfect. But it was still a good point to see the capabilities of Ursina Engine (which is the name of the library used to develop this).

**🧰 MADE USING**: Python 3.12 and [Ursina Engine](https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina).

**🛠️ Requirements:**
- Python 3.12+
- Ursina package installed
- Windows machine with GPU (recommended)
